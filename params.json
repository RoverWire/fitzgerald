{"body":"### Welcome to Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald is a tiny PHP framework that was inspired oh so heavily by the wondrous Sinatra of the Ruby world.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\n\r\nCopy the lib folder from the repo to your working directory. Create a file for your application for instance app.php. Inside this file include fitzgerald and subclass it:\r\n```php\r\ninclude('lib/fitzgerald.php');\r\n\r\nclass MyApplication extends Fitzgerald {\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCreate an index.php in you DOCUMENT_ROOT and include your app:\r\n```php\r\ninclude('../app.php');\r\n```\r\nCreate a .htaccess file with the following contents:\r\n```\r\nRewriteEngine On\r\nRewriteBase /\r\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\r\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\r\nRewriteRule . /index.php [L]\r\n```\r\nIn your app.php file create an instance of the subclacc you made. Add an action to the class and setup a route, than call the run() method of fitzgerald:\r\n```php\r\ninclude('lib/fitzgerald.php');\r\n\r\nclass MyApplication extends Fitzgerald {\r\n    public function get_index() {\r\n        return $this->render('index');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n$app = new MyApplication(array('layout' => 'mylayout'));\r\n// index action\r\n$app->get('/', 'get_index');\r\n\r\n$app->run();\r\n```\r\nCreate a layout and a view in the views folder and open the domain in a browser. You should see the contents of the index view.\r\n\r\nTo pass data to a view you need to pass it to the render function:\r\n```php\r\nclass MyApplication extends Fitzgerald {\r\n    public function get_index() {\r\n        return $this->render('index', array('data' => 'my test data'));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFitzgerald built by Jim Benton(@jim).","name":"Fitzgerald","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
